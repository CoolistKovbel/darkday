          Im just a dude who is trying to get back on track and get back what he
          lost. My time, money, my word I guess. Lost so much I am tired of it
          all. Feel so alone, not good enough, feel as if I watch my life wash
          away too much drama.. too much bs.. if none if this ever happenend you
          probably wouldnt be here and I wouldnt be communicating with you like
          this.
        </p>

          I have been learning to code and program, I am trying to get better
          than before as well as make money. Get back my friends, make some new
          friends, but most imporatantly dont hurt myself so much to the point
          where you know its not going to end well. What is life. Just want to
          code have a sexy woman next to me and we both progressing steadly
          towards our goals and win together.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 leading-2 text-md">
          I am usually a go get her type of guy. When I setup my goals I usually
          go hard at them unless there is something purposally playing around
          me, life is a little hard. I am fast learner and like to read, code,
          and do cool things. I have had a hard time growing up and being a teen
          and I guess adulting... but I try to not have things bring me down. I
          am going to be going through a little learning path which I may share,
          I feel like I lost how to communicate or talk about myself since my
          girl friend gave me a hard time and I guess nobody really asks me
          whats up.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 leading-2 text-md">
          I have been struggling with a few things but I am actually right
          around the corner with most things, I hope to be able to bring
          greatness to this world and make it somewhat better. I hope to not
          overshare or give emotional messages... please comment and help me go
          towards the right direction.
        </p>
